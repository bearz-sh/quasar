# Shell

Shell is a namespace for various cli wrappers for command line
applications to call from deno.

The core folder contains shared code and the script_runner folder
contains the script_runner object which some initial register scripts
that are invoke to allow calling pwsh, bash, sh, and powershell scripts
with the script runner.

Examples for script_runner can be found in the [tests](./script_runner/mod_test.ts)
file.

Functionality may be added over time to deal with package management
and provide more idomatic apis to make it easier to call the command
line applications from deno scripts.
